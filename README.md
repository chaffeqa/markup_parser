= Markup Parser

Creating my own rails wiki application forced me to do some research on markup parsers.
I ended up using a ton of Github solutions (and code) but in the end found their 'markup' gem to be a little cumbersome and behind some of the new advances (specifically [Redcarpet 2](https://github.com/tanoku/redcarpet))

So I created my own little library. 

## Goals

* Make the library simple (class oriented, easy to read, small)
* Standardize the parser usage 
* Allow leveraging the features and hooks of parsers

## Usage
